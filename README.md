# covid19-global-data-tracker
A data analysis project that visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data.


## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization report tracking global COVID-19 trends. Using real-world data, the tracker explores cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress across multiple countries over time. The project aims to provide insightful visualizations and narratives that help understand the pandemic's evolution worldwide.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data from reliable sources.
- Analyze time trends for COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare key metrics across selected countries.
- Create informative visualizations including line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Communicate insights through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook suitable for presentation or publication.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib & seaborn (for visualization)
- Optional: Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
4. Download the COVID-19 dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and place it in the `data` folder.
5. Open `covid19_tracker.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
6. Run all cells in order to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights
- The USA and India have the highest reported COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Vaccination rollouts show varied success across countries, affecting case trends.
- Higher vaccination coverage correlates with reductions in new cases in several regions.
- Death rates have generally decreased over time, reflecting improved treatment and vaccination impact.
- Data anomalies reveal the complexity of pandemic data collection and reporting.

## Reflections
Working on this project deepened my understanding of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques applied to real-world health data. It also highlighted the importance of clear communication when presenting complex data insights.
